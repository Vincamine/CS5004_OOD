1.I didn't use local variable cause :
(1)The result can be returned directly.
(2)It's more concise and readable to chain calls together without intermediate variables.
2.I use one helper method " checkEmpty()" to check if the VideoGamesCatalog is empty.
The reason is following the "one method one function" role.
